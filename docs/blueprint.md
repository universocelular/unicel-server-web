## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant blue (#5E5EFF) for key interactive elements and the header to capture user attention. This color provides a strong contrast on a light background.
- Background color: Use a very light gray (#F8FAFC) for the background to provide a clean, professional feel and ensure text and interactive elements stand out.
- Accent color: Employ a muted teal (#62BCA7), an analogous color to the primary blue, for secondary interactive elements and highlights, adding depth and visual interest without overwhelming the design.
- Font: Use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text, to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic throughout the app.
- Organize content in cards, providing a structured and visually appealing layout that aligns with modern UI patterns, based on the specifications provided by the design system.
- Use spacing based on multiples of 8px, from xs (4px) to xxl (64px), for consistent and proportional spacing between elements.
- Use rounded corners for buttons, inputs, and cards, with radii ranging from sm (4px) to lg (16px), as indicated in the design system.
